Homeautomation Project using RS485 and Arduino (but not limited to it)

Basic Stage : 

Arduino As Slave node (tested on Arduino Uno, Visduino UnoR3, ProMini 328)

Arduino As Master Node communication with a "PC" (im using an OrangePi Zero and for dev an old AMD System)

Communication is done thru cheap RS485 Modules becaue of the low price of approx 80cent and the pussibiity to run the bus with inexpensive unschieldet wires. I tested it with 400m with no problems.

Command : Slave01 12=1 (Slave #1 set port 12 to high)
